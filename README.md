# ðŸ’± IBC-Cosmos data

Why this repo?<br>
- At Pulsar we felt like there was a big gap on IBC data which prevented us from having a good way to match any IBC token to its original native token. This repo is meant to be kept updated with the current native and IBC tokens of each cosmos chain under https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry
<br>
Planning on adding more data in the future<br/><br/>
The file `ibc_data.min.json` is just a minified version of `ibc_data.json`<br/>
The file `native_token_data.min.json` is just a minified version of `native_token_data.json`<br/><br/>
